# Introduction 

Urbit is a new OS and peer-to-peer network thatâ€™s simple by design, built to last forever, and 100% owned by its users.
Urbit OS makes the server side usable for individuals without the need for MEGACORP to run their software. Urbit is your own personal server. 
Urbit is your last computer. Welcome.

## Deploy with balena

[balena](https://www.balena.io/what-is-balena/) is a complete set of tools for building, deploying and managing fleets of connected linux devices. We opted to use balena because it manages the whole lifecycle of our device and application. We only have to download the OS from our account and load it into the SD card for the Raspberry pi. 

balena is completely free for up to 10 devices and most of it's components are Open Source. 

The same setup will work flawlessly if you install another OS into the raspberry pi and use `docker-compose up`.
