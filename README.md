# Introduction

Urbit is a new OS and peer-to-peer network that‚Äôs simple by design, built to last forever, and 100% owned by its users.
Urbit OS makes the server side usable for individuals without the need for MEGACORP to run their software. Urbit is your own personal server.
Urbit is your last computer. Welcome.

## Project Status & Urbit Grant

The project is under heavy development, as we move away from an MVP and towards an aplpha version of the software.  You can follow the progress of the project via the `projects` tab in this GitHub repository.

## Known issues

- Reverse proxy was changed from `path-based` to `subdomain-based`. This means that in order to visit urbit, we go to `ship.<domain_name>` and not `<domain_name>/urbit`. This change was necessary as both `urbit` and `minio` expect to live in the root of the path `<domain_name>/`.
- Using the public device URL offered by balena is a stop-gap measure. Although the reverse-proxy will function as expected for most of the functionality, it's still not possible to use `minio` with `urbit`.
- balena public device URL is very slow, due to being served from US servers, even if the request and device lives in the EU.
- `urbit` continues to illustrate an abnormal lag, either due to the reverse proxy or to the SSD. The tested setup uses a RPI4 with a USB3 Samsung T5 external SSD.
- Raspberry Pi doesn't play out of the box with SSD. In order to boot from SSD, please follow the instructions [here](https://forums.balena.io/t/how-to-boot-balenaos-on-an-sSD-why-it-matters-and-how-it-works/341836).

## Deploy with balena

[balena](https://www.balena.io/what-is-balena/) is a complete set of tools for building, deploying and managing fleets of connected linux devices. We opted to use balena because it manages the whole lifecycle of our device and application. We only have to download the OS from our account and load it into the SD card for the Raspberry pi.

balena is completely free for up to 10 devices and most of it's components are Open Source.

The same setup will work flawlessly if you install another OS into the raspberry pi and use `docker-compose up`.


## Getting Started with a new comet

1. Click on the Button above

![](/assets/deploy1.png)

2. Create a balena account (or log in). Create application with default settings.

![](/assets/deploy2.png)

3. To add a device to the application, download the OS image and [flash](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) it to an SD card.

![](/assets/deploy3.png)

4. Insert the SD card to the Rasspberry pi 4, connect it to power + Internet. Wait to download your application.

5. Visit the Cloud Dashboard to see that everything works as expected

6. Click on the web terminal, select `urbit` and open a terminal session. Execute `/usr/sbin/get-urbit-code.sh`. This script will give you the code for your Urbit.

7. Visit the following address to access `~Urbit`: `ship.<device_public_url>`. Read more about [balena Public Device URLs](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/develop/runtime/#public-device-urls).

## Getting Started with a planet/star/galaxy keyfile

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/odyslam/home-urbit` on your computer.
2. Move the `<private_key_name>.key` file inside the `urbit/keys/` directory of the repo you just download. So `~/home-urbit/urbit/keys/<private_key_name>.key`
3. Create a [balena-cloud account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/apps), then create an application for device type ("Raspberry pi 4"). Let's name it `home-urbit`.
4. Download [balenacli](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md), install it and [sign into](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/) your account.
5. `cd` into the repo directory `home-urbit` and run `balena push home-urbit`.

The reason we can't follow the "Deploy with balena" button flow is that we need to add our key into the application files.

### ALTERNATIVE: Manually add the keyfile inside the urbit container

Balena builds the containers in a remote build server and send the binaries to our device. It means that whatever we add in the docker-compose application (e.g our keys), will live for a brief moment in balena's build servers, something which is not ideal from a security perspective.

The alternative is to deploy our application with the default settings and manually copy over our keys inside the container.

Define a [device service environment variable](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/serv-vars/#device-environment-and-service-variables) , with the following name and value: `TRANSFER_KEY`:`1`. The `urbit` container will start, but it will **not** start Urbit. Then you can ssh into the container (either using `balena ssh` or the web terminal) and manually copy over your key into the directory `urbit/keys`. After you do, remove the environment variable we just added. The container will restart and will pick up your key.

## Getting Started without balena

1. Download an OS system (e.g [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)). **Make sure it's 64-bit**.
2. Flash the image into an SD card.
3. Get terminal access to the machine (e.g using ssh) and [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/).
4. Install `git` , run `sudo apt-get install git`
5. Download this repository, run `git clone https://github.com/odyslam/home-urbit`
6. `cd` into the repository
7. run `sudo docker-compose up`
8. After you seee output from the Urbit container that references `localhost`, open a second terminal window.
9. In the second window, run `sudo docker ps` to find the `ID` of the container that runs `urbit`.
10. Run `sudo docker exec -it /bin/bash/ <container_ID`. You will get a new terminal inside the container.
11. Run `/usr/sbin/get-urbit-code.sh`. You should see a code on the terminal. That's the password for your ship. Note it down.
12. Type `exit` to exit the shell.
13. visit `<raspberrypi_IP>` from a browser and enter the code you noted.
14. Celebrate üçæ

## Environment variables by container

### Urbit

- `$AMES_PORT`: The port for the ames protocol. Default value: `34343`
- `$PIER_NAME`: Name of the pier the user wants to boot from. Useful if there are more than 1 `pier` available.
- `$TRANSFER_KEY`: If set to `1`, the `urbit` container will start but it will **not** start urbit. The container will idle and the user can `ssh` into the container to place their key in `keys` directory. The key should have the form `<name>.key`.

## Netdata

- `$NETDATA_CLAIM_TOKEN`: Claim token for Netdata Cloud
- `$NETDATA_CLAIM_ROOMS`: War-room to add the Netdata Agent
- `$NETDATA_CLAIM_URL`: "https://app.netdata.cloud"
- `$DO_NOT_TRACK`: Set to 1 to disable anonymous product usage statistics for the Netdata agent.

To read more about claiming the Netdata Agent on Netdata Cloud, visit [Netdata Learn](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/claim#claim-an-agent-running-in-docker).

### Caddy

- `$DOMAIN`: The user for Nginx authentication. Default: home-urbit
- `$PROTOCOL`: What protocol is used to access Home-Urbit. Default is `http`.

### Minio-s3

- `$MINIO_ROOT_USER`: The user for minio authnetication. Default: home-urbit
- `$MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`: The password for minio authnetication. Default: home-urbit

- How to add environment variables with Docker/Docker-compose: [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/)
- How to add environment variables with balena: [balena docs](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/serv-vars/)

## Helper scripts

These helper scripts are available inside the `urbit` container. To run them, `ssh` into the container either using the `balena` CLI tool or via the web terminal.

- `/usr/sbin/get-urbit-code.sh`: Get your Ship's code. This is required so that you can log into your ship for the first time.
- `/usr/sbin/reset-urbit-code.sh`: Reset your Ship's code.
- **Advanced users:**`/usr/sbin/run-urbit-cmd.sh -a <app> -c <ommand> -s <stdout>`: Run any command on your Urbit.

## Tips

- You can ssh into your device via balena webterminal, balena ssh, and regular ssh. Read more on the [docs](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/ssh-access/).
- You can tunnel any connection from your local computer to any port on the device, using [balena tunnel](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/#tunnel-deviceorapplication).
- With docker, we can't automatically set the hostname of the device. Thus, you will need to access it via the IP and not `homeurbit.local`. If you want to [change](https://blog.jongallant.com/2017/11/raspberrypi-change-hostname/) the hostname of your Raspberry Pi.
