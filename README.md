# Introduction 

Urbit is a new OS and peer-to-peer network that‚Äôs simple by design, built to last forever, and 100% owned by its users.
Urbit OS makes the server side usable for individuals without the need for MEGACORP to run their software. Urbit is your own personal server. 
Urbit is your last computer. Welcome.

[![balena deploy button](https://github.com/OdysLam/home-urbit/blob/master/assets/Deploy%20Urbit%20with%20Balena.svg?raw=true)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/OdysLam/home-urbit)

## Deploy with balena

[balena](https://www.balena.io/what-is-balena/) is a complete set of tools for building, deploying and managing fleets of connected linux devices. We opted to use balena because it manages the whole lifecycle of our device and application. We only have to download the OS from our account and load it into the SD card for the Raspberry pi. 

balena is completely free for up to 10 devices and most of it's components are Open Source. 

The same setup will work flawlessly if you install another OS into the raspberry pi and use `docker-compose up`.

## Getting Started

1. Click on the Button above

![](/assets/deploy1.png)

2. Create a balena account (or log in). Create application with default settings.

3. To add a device to the application, download the OS image and [flash](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) it to an sd card.

4. Insert the sd card to the Rasspberry pi 4, connect it to power + Internet. Wait to donwload your application. 

5. Visit the Cloud Dashboard to see that everything works as expected

6. Click on the web terminal, select `urbit` and open a terminal session. Run command `/usr/sbin/get-urbit-code.sh`. This command will give you the code for your Urbit. By default, it will boot a **new** comet.

7. Visit the following address to access `~Landscape`: <ip_address>:8080. e.g 192.168.1.249:8080 (as you can see from the cloud dashboard above).

## Getting Started without balena

1. Download an OS system (e.g [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)). **Make sure it's 64-bit**.
2. Flash the image into an sd card.
3. Get terminal access to the machine (e.g using ssh) and [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/).
4. Install `git` , run `sudo apt-get install git`
5. Download this repository, run `git clone https://github.com/odyslam/home-urbit`
6. `cd` into the repository
7. run `sudo docker-compose up`
8. After you seee output from the Urbit container that references `localhost`, open a second terminal window. 
9. In the second window, run `sudo docker ps` to find the `ID` of the container that runs `urbit`. 
10. Run `sudo docker exec -it /bin/bash/ <container_ID`. You will get a new terminal inside the container.
11. Run `/usr/sbin/get-urbit-code.sh`. You should see a code on the terminal. That's the password for your ship. Note it down.
12. Type `exit` to exit the shell. 
13. visit `<raspberrypi_IP>` from a browser and enter the code you noted. 
14. Celebrate üçæ


## Configure minio S3 storage

![](/assets/minio.gif)

1. Visit Landscape System Preferences
2. Go to remote storage
3. Add `minio-s3:9000` as the endpoint
4. Add username/password (default are `home-urbit`/`home-urbit`)
5. ü§ô
